# Getting Set Up With Learn

## Objectives
+ SWBAT set up their Learn accounts.
+ SWBAT Understand the purpose and structure of Learn

## Lesson Plan

+ Have students head to GitHub.com and sign up for an account. Give a basic explanation that Github is a way to store code on the internet and work on it collaboratively with other people. Think of it as "Google Docs for Code"

+ Have students head to Learn.co and sign up. They'll be prompted to download the Learn IDE (Atom), which they should go ahead and do (it's about 70 MB). Once this is done, have them open up the IDE and get connected using their access token (The IDE supplies a link to get the token).

+ Explain to the students that Learn is the way that we'll be managing our lessons and assignments. The course will have a bunch of labs - this is where you're going to go to download and work with the labs.

+ Atom is a text editor. All code is just text that is "interpreted" by the computer. That is, code is converted into 1s and 0s that the computer can understand. We use text editors to write our code.

+ Make sure all students are connected and up and running
